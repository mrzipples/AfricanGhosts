        <h1 class="slideInRight">African ghosts in Sicily</h1>
        <p>Political and social instability, economic deprivation and conflict have forced thousands of people to flee their homelands in sub-Saharan Africa, their hopes for a better life far outweighing any fear of the long and dangerous journey to Europe. </p>
        <p>They risk it all - crossing deserts, enduring brutality in the prisons of Libya and embarking on perilous voyages across the Mediterranean on rafts and old fishing boats.</p>
        <p>Many of those who make it come ashore in Sicily. Although most see Sicily as a gateway to their desired final destination, Europe, once here, they find themselves in limbo, living in community or reception centres as they wait for residence permits that may take years to come, if they come at all.</p>
        <p>Unable to work and with little else to do, some wander aimlessly through the streets or engage in what seems to be an endless bureaucratic battle. Others give up and attempt to flee yet again. A few even contemplate the previously unthinkable: giving up and returning home. </p>
        <p>These are the ghosts of Sicily, trapped in a place where they do not wish to be and cannot build a life. A place where their time is measured out by others, their identities go unrecognised, their dreams and ambitions denied and their lives placed on hold.</p>

        <p>Lamin, 21, left Gambia for a better life. He journeyed with 31 others for 10 days across the Sahara Desert in a Jeep. At one point, the car overturned and one of his travelling companions was killed.</p>
        <p>After hiding for months in Tripoli, fearful of his stay in Libya, Lamin paid the fees to cross the sea in one of two boats headed towards Sicily.  A few hours into the journey, the boat began to sink. In desperation, those on board tried to expel the water by any means – some even scooping it out with their hands.</p>
<P>The Italian navy reached them just in time, but the second boat travelling alongside them never made it ashore. At least 45 people died in that shipwreck, among them Lamin’s uncle and cousin. Now in Italy, he says that he wants to learn the language in the hope of finding work and restarting a new life.</p>

        <p>Samate Madu, 18,  from Casamance in Senegal,  fled after rebel fighters tried to draft him into their ranks. For two months, he trekked to Mali on trucks through smuggling trails.  From there, he went on to Niger, where he had spent weeks working as a tailor to pay for his journey towards Libya.</p>
<p>When he arrived in the North African country, he boarded a ship towards Italy with 100 others. The Italian coastguard rescued them after seven hours at sea. An ardent AC Milan soccer fan, Samate had always dreamed of becoming a footballer. "My mother is back in the village,” he says. “I have to help her."</p>

        <p> Back home in Gambia, Bamba Ji was a student with a great passion for football, running out to play nearly every day after school.</p>
        <p>The 19-year-old’s journey by boat to reach the Sicilian coast has been horrendous. A friend who was travelling with him drowned during a rescue operation by a cargo ship in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
        <p>Today, in Sicily, with thoughts of his uncle still haunting him, Osman is determined to continue his journey to Sweden to find work and study journalism.</p>

        <p>Osman, 24, fled from his home in Guinea with his uncle in search of a better life, away from harsh poverty and unemployment. They first made their way to Libya, where they spent three months in hiding for fear of being arrested or mugged. He was separated from his uncle amid the chaos on the Libyan port.</p>
        <p>His journey to Sicily was tragic. Some 45 people on the overcrowded boat died from asphyxiation. Five days after arriving in Italy, he saw his uncle’s body lying in a coffin. </p>
        <p>He would like to one day tell a story with a happier ending – a story of his county’s rebirth and the end of the mass immigration, though his story, he believes, will never have a happy ending.</p>

        <p>Mohammad, 18, was a student from Gambia, where he had lived with his three sisters. His journey to Sicily began on a bus ride from Gambia, crossing through Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. From Niger, he travelled in the back of a truck, packed in with 50 others on a four-day trudge into Libya in what he says was the hardest and most dangerous of his entire trip.</p>
        <p>He remained in Libya for two months, working at a car wash. With the little money he earned, he paid for the boat trip to Sicily, which was intercepted by the Italian navy after only a day.</p>
        <p>Mohammad has a brother in Finland and hopes to join him and work as a programmer. His dream is to send a portion of the money he earns back to his three sisters in Gambia.</p>

        <p>Kebbi,  18, right, from Gambia, left behind a large family - he is the youngest of eight brothers. In his country, he had worked as a tailor in the family business. After growing tired of this work, he left without informing his family.</p>
       <p>On arriving in Libya, after a hard and dangerous journey, his father called him and warned him against taking the trip to Italy. His 11-month stay in Libya was difficult: he was arrested for entering the country illegally and spent three months in prison. An old friend from his village paid for his release from prison. To repay the debt and buy a trip to Sicily, he had to work for several months as a bricklayer.The sea journey to Italy was risky. After leaving the port of Zuwara in a rubber dinghy holding more than100 people, he sailed for more than three days. Food ran out after only a day, and they were forced to drink seawater, which led to stomach pain.</p>
       <p>The overcrowded dinghy then began to fill with water, and those on board were forced to scoop the water out by hand. After sending a series of emergency calls in the dead of night, the Italian navy sent a helicopter but in the darkness, it couldn’t find them. Hours later, a Dutch cargo ship rescued them. Now in Sicily, Kebbi says he will do anything for his father’s forgiveness. He hopes to find a job as a tailor and send money back home.</p>

        <p>He spent nine days trekking through the desert, where his group was robbed. Once he reached the Libyan city of Bahe, he sought work to fund the crossing into Italy.</p>
        <p>For the journey by boat, he spent 850 dinars ($590). Only two days into the trip, his boat was rescued by Italian coastguards. Though he has no one in Italy, Yacumba hopes to remain and find work as a carpenter.</p>

      	<p>Palamin, 17, is from Gambia and comes from a very poor family. He stopped going to school to help his family by working as an electrician and bricklayer, but his earnings were not enough, and he decided to go to Europe.</p>
<p>His trip across the desert was difficult and took him five days to reach Libya.</p>
<p>In Tripoli, he was arrested. “The police gave me a phone to call my family and ask for money,” he says. “But my family is very poor and cannot send even one euro for me”. </p>
<p>Not believing his family couldn’t afford to pay, he was beaten each day and remained in jail for four months, until he escaped. He was taken in by “a very good man”, who gave him food and clothing, even helping Palamin board a boat for Italy without paying.</p>
<p>Five hours into the trip, the boat began to sink. They called for the Italian coastguard, who took more than an hour to reach them. “Those moments were endless. We all thought we would die since we were 68 people and the boat was quickly sinking," Palamin says. The Italian navy rescued them just in time.
Now in Sicily, he hopes to learn the language and then find a good job that would help his family in Gambia.</p>

        Musa, 19, worked as a bricklayer in Senegal. He had never had the opportunity to study, having been born in a very large family. His passion, which he feels helped him during the harsh trip to Sicily, was reciting the Quran. He arrived in Libya and was able almost immediately to embark for Sicily. His boat was rescued after only two days at sea. His dream of a better life is to go to England or the United States, where he hopes to find work as a bricklayer and continue to study the Quran.

There, they were jailed for six months, where guards beat them frequently. His brother managed to escape from jail. When he tried to cross into Europe, he drowned in the Mediterranean.

        <p>Mahari Haile Mdtaiwalta,18, from Eritrea, was in 7th grade when he fled his autocratic country, he says, because he "feared military service with no end". Traffickers took him by foot, forcing him to walk for four hours across the Sudanese border, where he then walked for five days straight. He crossed the border into Libya in a lorry. His journey cost a small fortune, he says. He paid about $1,600 to various traffickers between Eritrea and Tripoli, then a further $2,200 to cross the Mediterranean. He boarded a boat in Zuwara, Libya, along with 240 others. The Italian coastguard rescued the boat and brought them to Sicily.</p>

        <p>Alagie, 19, is from Gambia.  Since childhood, he worked as a weaver of African clothing. He travelled to Sicily in hope for a better life. His experience of the trip to Libya from Niger was horrendous. He travelled for six days across the desert, crowded together with 35 other people in the back of a pick-up truck, with only one litre of water. The truck driver had thrown away all the bags, including clothing and documents, to lighten the load.</p>
        <p>In Libya, Alagie remained for two weeks before taking a boat to Sicily from the port of Zuwara. After two days, they were rescued by the Italian navy.
His dream now is to reach Switzerland or Germany, where he hopes to continue his work as a weaver.

        <p>Ebrima was born in Gambia, the second son in a family of seven children. The 17-year-old studied until last year when he decided to go to Europe. After reaching Libya, he endured three difficult months. He lost two close friends in a car accident and barely escaped being arrested. He earned more than $2,000 needed to reach Sicily by boat working as a bricklayer. His experience during the sea crossing was tough. "You begin to lose your mind when you can’t see land - only sky and sea for days. In those conditions, only God can help you".</p>
        <p>After Sicily, once he obtains his documents, he hopes to move to northern Europe and work in a field of art. He says that his experiences were so tough that he would not repeat it. Although he misses this brothers, he warned them against making the dangerous trip.</p>
